# Unsupervised Speech Recognition

Automatic Speech Recognition is the task of transforming a speech waveform into a transcript sequence. Previous SOTA algorithms in this field mainly use supervised learning or semi-supervised learning, limiting the recognition to widely used languages only. However, in 2021, Baevski et al. instroduced a well performing unsupervised speech recognition algorithm called wave2vec_U in [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.11084.pdf). The unsupervised property makes it possible to do automatic speech recognition on low-resource languages. We researched and implemented this method by ourselves using PyTorch, together with an ablation study attempting to improve the baseline performance.

Since this is a class assignment, my code is not published on GitHub. Please read our [project report](https://github.com/HonglingLei/Unsupervised-Speech-Recognition/blob/main/11685_HW5_final_report_JingLi_HonglingLei.pdf) (Jing Li & Hongling Lei) for more details.
